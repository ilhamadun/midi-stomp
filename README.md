# MIDI Stomp

Poor Man's MIDI Controller.

## Background

I recently played an [Line 6 HX Stomp](https://line6.com/hx-stomp/). It was truly amazing and fun to play. However as
the cost of being a stompbox-sized device it only has three footswitches built-in. I wanted more control, and
fortunately the HX Stomp supports an external MIDI controller.

There are a lot of MIDI controller on the market, but where's the fun in that?

## Roadmap

- [ ] Digital Inputs
- [ ] Static MIDI Control Change
- [ ] External screen support
- [ ] Configurable Control Change number
- [ ] MIDI Program Change
- [ ] Preset Bank
- [ ] MIDI In to change banks

## MIDI Compatibility Target

Although I made this for HX Stomp, this should support other MIDI-compatible devices.
